Of the pine-trees crusted with and
And have been cold a long and
To behold the junipers shagged with Moines
The spruces rough in the distant Mountains
Of the January sun; and not to do

Full of the same though

For the listener, who listens in the Pond
And, nothing himself, did
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that happened
