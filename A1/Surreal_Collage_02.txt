A surreal photomontage collage of a large modern Tokyo night street in full color and realistic 3D perspective, neon signs, wet pavement reflections, crowds, vending machines and cables, with a classical Persian miniature court lady rendered in flat black and white, long dark hair, ornate crown, Safavid manuscript style, cut out like a paper sticker and pasted onto a glowing alley wall or shop shutter, hard torn edges, visible glue, slightly tilted like urban poster art, mismatched scale, layered newspaper textures and torn advertisements around her, additional small collage fragments like mythical birds, miniature flowers, and Persian script floating between the lights, strong contrast between saturated futuristic city and monochrome ancient figure, Dada and Hannah Höch photomontage style, time collision, exile, cultural displacement, not painterly, not blended, obvious cut-and-paste collage, cinematic depth in background, flat 2D figure in foreground
