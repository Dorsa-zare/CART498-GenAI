 A surreal photomontage collage of a large modern London street scene in full color and realistic 3D perspective, busy with buildings, signs, cars and pedestrians, with a classical Persian miniature princess rendered in flat black and white, long dark hair, jeweled crown, Safavid manuscript style, cut out like a paper sticker and pasted onto a wall or sidewalk, hard torn edges, visible glue, slightly tilted like street art, mismatched scale, layered newspaper textures and ripped posters around her, additional small collage fragments like birds, calligraphy, and floral motifs floating in space, strong contrast between colorful contemporary city and monochrome ancient figure, Dada and Hannah Höch photomontage style, time collision, exile, cultural displacement, not painterly, not blended, obvious cut-and-paste collage, cinematic depth in background, flat 2D figure in foreground
